# BymlEditor
A full-sized editor for Nintendo's Binary YAML File format.

### Coming soon: A README.md

This project is far from done, the current release is **just working**.

Currently, the tool can only **read** files, and neither edit them, nor import-export them from/to other formats. These features will be
added soon though.
